# Wayfinder Icons

A set of icons for use with Waybar.

## ToDo!

- [x] Add Bluetooth icon and Bluetooth off icon.
- [x] Put all icons in private use area.
- [ ] Make icons accessible with ligatures. E.g., “[icon-wifi]” should display a wifi icon. “[icon-battery-critical]”, “[icon-battery-low]”, “[icon-battery-mid]”, etc.
- [ ] Add more volume, media and playback related icons, including play/pause and headphones.

### Extra

- [ ] Make a sharply squared/angular icon set as well. (Use variable features so that, if supported, the battery can charge/drain using only one glyph, for example.)
